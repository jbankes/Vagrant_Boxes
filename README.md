#Vagrant Boxes 
Vagrantfiles for my personal projects and work. I decided to make these public
to help other people download boxes from Vagrant. 

####Requirements
These should work with Mac, popular flavors of \*nix, and Windows. 
1. Vagrant
  1. Vagrant 1.8.6 though Vagrant 1.8.4 will work. 
2. VirtualBox
  1. Virtualbox 5.1.x with Vagrant 1.8.6
  2. Virtualbox 5.0.26 with Vagrant 1.8.4
 
####How to Use
1. Clone the Repo
2. Move the Vagrantfile to a directory where you want to run the box.
3. Run ```vagrant up``` 
4. ```vagrant ssh``` will get you in the system.    
5. After you are done with the box you can run ```vagrant destroy```


#####Thanks
I am not connected to Hashicorp in any way other than being a fan of their 
products. If there is an issue with something then create an issue.
